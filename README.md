## Software that we like
* **Visual Studio Code:** There are a number of text editors that you can use for writing your code, and it ultimately doesn't matter which one you use...but we like using Visual Studio Code by Microsoft, there are a lot of handy extensions that make your life easier when you code. Download [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Workflow
At the very minimum, you will need a text editor (see above) and Git installed on your machine. Instructions on installing and configuring Git for both Windows and Mac can be found [here](https://atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git). 

To get a local copy of this repository on your machine, boot up Terminal / Command Line, navigate to the directory where you want to store the code using `cd` and type in the following command: `git clone https://github.com/kevinjihwanlee/ie3-app-dev.git`. You should see some lines of text indicating progress and eventually a finish - if you check your directory afterwards, you should see a copy of the repository.

You can now open up the entire folder of code in Visual Studio Code. Boot up VSCode and go to "File -> Open...", and make sure you select the entire folder instead of individual files of code. You should now see the entire directory in the sidebar within VSCode.

We will eventually cover git branching and then pull requests, but let's make sure everything works up to this point.
