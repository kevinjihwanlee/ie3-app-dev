## The Application
At Northwestern University, there lacks a standardized platform for students to host events in a medium that can reach students outside their own social circle. The ineffectiveness of Facebook and postering as advertisement mediums fails to inform students about events happening on campus. 

This is where veNU comes in. Built entirely in React Native, veNU is a modern, minimalist mobile application to enable students to post about their events and find out about others'. veNU allows users to post and view events in a map format, sort by Hot and New events, and hear about events and groups that they never would have been able to otherwise.
